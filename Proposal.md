For our project we are looking at opioid datasets.
First we will be displaying three different csv files containing information about opioid names, opioid deaths, and opioate prescriber information.
Next we will be cleaning up the data by removing any null rows or fixing typos.
Then we will be making a schema file to make tables in a database so that we can input our clean data into a sql database.
Last we will be joining the tables made in order to consolidate the data for later presentation to data analysts.
